	//Abstraction - is a process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality
	//In Java Abstraction can be achieved in 2 ways: 
	//Abstract Class 
	//Interfaces
	
	// Abstract class is a class defined with abstract keyword and it has implemented(Methods that have body) and unimplemented methods (methods that do not have body)
	
	//abstract - is non access modifier
				//is a keyword that identifies somethig in completed
	
	//undefined/unimplemented/abstract methods --> methods without the body
	//public abstract void takePictures();
	
	
//	below method is not abstract as it has a body{},
//	you will get a complier error
//	public abstract void takePictures
	
	
// Can abstract method be private? No!!!
// Can an abstract method be final?? No!!
// Can an absstract methods be static? HELL TO THE FUCK NAH
